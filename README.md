# Late Night Jazz Hour üé∂

This repository contains my term project for the **History of Jazz** course, a creative impression letter based on Stanley Clarke‚Äôs 2015 live performance at the North Sea Jazz Festival.

Rather than writing a standard reflection, I decided to approach the assignment as if hosting a fictional radio show segment. What came out was *Late Night Jazz Hour*, a deeply personal, immersive, and playful exploration of jazz through storytelling, imagination, and emotional response.

## What's Inside

- **A radio-style impression letter** that blends live concert commentary, jazz history, and listener interactions (yes, fictional ones).
- Reflections on:
  - Jazz fusion and improvisation
  - Emotional expression without lyrics
  - Stanley Clarke‚Äôs legacy and stage presence
  - What it means to "listen" to jazz as a newcomer
